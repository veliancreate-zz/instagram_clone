Instagram Challenge
===================

## Tech used

Ruby, Rails (Devise, Omniauth, Active Record), Rspec, Capybara, AJAX, SASS

## Lessons learned

I felt pleased that I was able to complete this challenge successfully. The result felt more like a 'proper' web app as there is a proper user verification with Devise, Facebook login, commenting on posts and even 'likes'. I'd like to use Angular to create filters for search functionality as well.
